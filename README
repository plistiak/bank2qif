= Goals =

This script can convert bank statements from several banks into QIF file
format that can be processed by KMyMoney and some other financial
software.

If you can provide additional bank statement converters I'll gladly
add them.

This was originally mbank2qif, but was renamed after addition of
Unicredit converter. See https://github.com/sochotnicky/mbank2qif for
history

= Supported Banks =
 * mBank (CZ,SK)
 * Unicredit (CZ)
 * Fio (CZ)
 * Zuno (SK)
 * Slovenska Sporitelna (SK)

= Usage =
For help use:
$ ./bank2qif.py -h

The way bank2qif is designed (using stdin/out) it can be used as KMyMoney
import filter.
